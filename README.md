## Sequential Segmentation Algorithm

This is the Python + Cython implementation of the Bayesian Sequential Segmentation Algorithm.
If you use this algorithm, please cite:

The module is composed of two classes: 

OceanPod - an interface class to allow easy reading and processing of files from the OceanPod hydrophone
SeqSeg - the interface for the segmentation algortihm

In this repository we also included 3 signal files for testing, in the folder Data/. Please see main.py for details.
There are also two jupyter notebooks on /notebooks with the code used to generate tests of the Fast Implementation paper.
